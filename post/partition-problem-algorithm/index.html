		<p><strong>Partition Problem Algorithm</strong>. The optimization version of the problem is NP-Hard in the following wikipedia page an 76 approximation algorithm is described. Thek-partitioning problem is defined as follows. In ear-lier work Brunetta et al. More specifically we want to use the divide and conquer method.</p>

<p>Partition problem is to determine whether a given set can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is the same. The idea is to calculate the sum of all elements in the set say sum. In the partition problem we want to partition a set S of positive integers into two sets S 1 and S 2 such that the sum of the integers in the two sets is the same. For this problem a given set can be partitioned in such a way that sum of each subset is equal. In the 3partition problem the goal is to partition S into 3 subsets with an equal sum. According to the NP completeness of the problem is there an explicit polynomial algorithm to do it.</p>

<p>At first we have to find the sum of the given set. If sum is even check if a subset with sum2 exists or not. Now suppose I find a partition whose difference is 28 and let imagine there is only one better possible partition. The Partition Problem has an optimal. Given a set of items I 1I 2I n where itemIj is of weightwj 0 find a partitionS 1S 2S m of this set with S i k such that the maximum weight of all subsetsS i is minimalk-partitioning is strongly related to the classical multiprocessor scheduling problem of minimizing the makespan on identical machines. Get our collection of elements There is a given collection of elements numbers etc on which we would like to.</p>

Thoughts The brute force method will be to list down all the subsets of the given set and find the sum of each one of them. A perfect partition is always desired yet not all sets have a perfect partition as shown in the second example below. Arr 1 5 11 5 Output. More specifically if you had an efficient algorithm for solving your problem it would also be able to efficiently solve the two problems above which is impossible unless P NP.</p>
