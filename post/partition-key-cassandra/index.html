<p>Ordered means that a row with partition key equals to 1 will be always placed before the row with the partition key equals to 2. If in my cassandra CF RowKey is a b c and my data is highly skewed with cardinality of a being lets say just one. Cassandra performs these read and write operations by looking at a partition key in a table and using tokens a long value out of range -263 to 263-1 for data distribution and indexing.

A partitioner determines how data is distributed across the nodes in the cluster including replicas. I am still confused that the Partitioner needs to know the Partition Key. If in my cassandra CF RowKey is a b c and my data is highly skewed with cardinality of a being lets say just one. Notice that there is still one-and-only-one record updated with new c1 and c2 values in Cassandra by the primary key k1k1-1 and k2k2-1.</p>

<p>Active 6 years 6 months ago. Basically a partitioner is a function for deriving a token representing a row from its partition key typically by hashing. Partitioning key columns are used by Cassandra to spread the records across the cluster. If you did not specify any partitioning key then it might be the chance of losing data. Notice that there is still one-and-only-one record updated with new c1 and c2 values in Cassandra by the primary key k1k1-1 and k2k2-1.</p>
